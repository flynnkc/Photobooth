These scripts have been written so that I can use them as a photo booth for my wedding. I'm running them off of a Raspberry Pi 3b+ with Camera Module v2. For a flash I am using a 24 LED RGBW Adafruit Neopixel Ring. To activate an arcade button will be mounted for the subject to push to begin the picture-capture process. After the pictures are taken they will be stored locally and pushed remotely to an outside service such as Twitter, Google Photos, or a Wordpress site.

This is a work in progress and subject to change frequently. Not all features that I would like to add are present or working. I'm a student so this is just something I've been doing in my free time.
