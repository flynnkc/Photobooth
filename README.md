These scripts have been written so that I can use them as a photo booth for my wedding. I'm running them off of a Raspberry Pi 3b+ with Camera Module v2. For a flash I am using a 24 LED RGBW Adafruit Neopixel Ring. To activate an arcade button will be mounted for the subject to push to begin the picture-capture process. After the pictures are taken they will be stored locally and pushed remotely to an outside service such as Twitter, Google Photos, or a Wordpress site.

This is a work in progress and subject to change frequently. Not all features that I would like to add are present or working. I'm a student so this is just something I've been doing in my free time. If you see some code you like feel free to take it, as long as it obeys the terms of the GNU license.

Thanks,
KC Flynn
